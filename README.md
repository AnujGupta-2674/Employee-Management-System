# Employee Management System

This Employee Management System is a web application built using React and Tailwind CSS, designed to manage and track employee data. It offers a simple interface where admin can assign task to the employess, employees can login using their credintals to view the task assigned to them with the record of how much task is completed, new task assigned by the admin and failed task  with data stored in the browser's localStorage. This setup ensures a lightweight experience without the need for a backend server.

The project showcases a clean and functional UI, leveraging Tailwind CSS for styling and React for interactive features. Ideal for small-scale applications, this system provides essential management functionalities while keeping data persistent within the local storage, allowing users to revisit and access their data anytime on the same browser.
